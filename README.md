##Community Plan    %aa001

This is for learners of all skill sets—from beginner to advanced—to learn from and help each other excel in the world of code.

We encourage you to leverage your community of peers to get the most out of your learning journey.

##Considerations    %aa002

Facebook as a platform only provides a stream of posts. As such, the number of posts per day should be limited in order to keep the quality and purpose of those posts which there are as high as possible. Single purpose content posts should probably be aggregated into periodic posts by category. An example could be posts on a single programming topic or questions about specific problems. A subreddit may be useful for this purpose. 

High level articles of general interest can perhaps be posted as their own posts. Examples could be 'how to get a programming job,' a post about machine learning technology that considers the entire field, or an article about the state of data science. Examples that would not be suffiently high level and should probably be aggregated would be how to use one command in one programming language, an article on one use case of machine learning (unless said article uses the one case to put the field in perspective), or one particluar data science problem.

Given the nature of Facebook, questions about solving specific problems related to a project should be either aggregated to a weekly post or moved to a subreddit. If there are more than a 6 to 8 posts on the page a day, it will most likely become overwhelming. If someone has a post they think might be appropriate for everyone but are not totally sure, they might check with a moderator.
